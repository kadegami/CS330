Reflection
How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, my approach revolves around understanding the problem, defining clear objectives, and planning out the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome. 
For this 3D desk project, I began by conceptualizing the scene I wanted to create. I visualized the elements that would make the scene realistic and relatable, such as everyday 
items one would find on an office desk. This helped me set a clear direction for my work.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me develop several key design skills, including:

Attention to Detail: Ensuring that objects were proportionate and accurately textured to resemble real-world items.
Lighting Design: Learning how to manipulate light sources to create realistic shadows and highlights, which added depth to the scene.
Texture Application: Understanding how to apply different textures to objects to distinguish materials, such as the matte texture for the desk surface and the glossy finish
for the computer monitor.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process involved several stages:

Conceptualization: Defining the theme of the scene and selecting objects that fit the theme.
Modeling: Creating 3D models of each object using tools like Blender and applying basic geometric shapes.
Texturing: Applying textures to each object to enhance realism, using image editing software to create custom textures where necessary.
Lighting: Experimenting with different light placements and intensities to achieve the desired mood and realism.
Iteration: Continuously refining the scene based on feedback and testing, adjusting textures, lighting, and object placement as needed.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I employed in this project—such as iterative design, careful attention to detail, and effective use of textures and lighting—can be applied to any future 
projects involving 3D modeling, game design, or even user interface design. These skills are transferable and will help in creating visually appealing and user-friendly designs.

How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to developing programs is methodical and iterative. I start with a clear understanding of the requirements and then break down the development process into manageable
tasks. For the 3D desk project, I used a modular approach, focusing on one element of the scene at a time.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
During this project, I utilized several new development strategies:

Modular Development: Breaking down the scene into individual objects and developing each one separately before integrating them into the final scene.
Use of Libraries: Leveraging the stb_image.h library to handle texture loading, which streamlined the development process.
Iterative Testing: Regularly testing the scene at various stages to ensure that each component functioned correctly before moving on to the next.
How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a critical part of my development process. I frequently revisited earlier stages of the project to make improvements. For example, after initially
setting up the lighting, I went back to adjust textures to better match the lighting conditions, ensuring a cohesive and realistic look.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code became more structured and efficient. I learned to plan ahead, anticipate potential challenges, and address them 
proactively. My coding practices improved, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I also became more adept at using version control to manage changes
and collaborate effectively.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the foundational skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the ever-evolving field of technology. By mastering computational graphics and visualization,
I am expanding my skill set to include areas that are increasingly relevant in fields such as game development, virtual reality, and digital media.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The skills I've gained in computational graphics and visualization will be valuable as I continue my studies in computer science. These skills are applicable in courses related to
game design, simulation, and user experience design. Understanding the principles of 3D graphics will also enhance my ability to work with graphical APIs and develop interactive
applications.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, the ability to create realistic 3D models and scenes is highly sought after in industries such as gaming, film, virtual reality, and architectural visualization.
By building a portfolio that showcases my capabilities in these areas, I can open doors to opportunities in these fields. Additionally, the problem-solving and critical thinking 
skills developed through this project are universally applicable and valuable in any tech-related career.
